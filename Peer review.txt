sarthak peer review
---------------------------------
1. The user interface is rather generic and structure is needed.
2. Add a pause at the start of the program such as "Welcome player".
3. Addition of comments to address the section of code
4. Sarthak could add sections of an mmorpg through class that 
represent the assortment of gear and weapons.
5. Code instantiation was well done aswell as the methods.

For me-
Great interface could be improved
Word limit on cin input
Need comments
Add subjects
height
age
Age group/year
hobbies
need inheritance and plymorhpisim and encapsulation
std::getline (std::cin,age);
Control structure like if and else
